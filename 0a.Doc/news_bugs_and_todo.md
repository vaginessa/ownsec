# Latest issues/news, bugs whatever ....

- Node/npm installation off git replaced by NVM, speeds up part 2 significantly. If issues occour may revert back to the github script located here `ownsec/0.Initial/src/PT2/1.Deps_Install/2.Node-Npm_Install_GitHub.sh`, scripts to install source off node site may come later.
- Apt-lists for part 3 are now in the  same dir as install scripts.
- More Documentation added `ownsec/0a.Doc/`
